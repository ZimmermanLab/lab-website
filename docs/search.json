We accept between 2-5 students per cohort to work directly with a faculty mentor on a thesis project that is of mutual interest. All admitted students receive a full-tuition scholarship and have the ability to apply to be a Teaching Assistant to earn a stipend.\nThe most important thing to consider when joining a lab as part of a research-based Master’s degree is fit with the other members of the lab and alignment of research interests with the group. For serious potential applicants, we can set up meetings with other folks in the group and have a discussion about potential research projects. These discussions should happen before you apply.\nThe requirements for the MS degree in Biology include some coursework, but the primary task is to develop (in consultation with your mentor) a research project proposal, defend the proposal before a committee of faculty, complete the proposed research and write it up as a thesis, and then present and defend that thesis in a public defense and meeting with your thesis committee.\nTo get a sense of the scope of MS theses written by students in the program, you can browse recent theses in the USF Scholarship Repository."

How are endophytic communities associated with street trees and other plants growing throughout cities contributing to its microbial mileau?\nThis work was initially led by honors undergraduate Emma Gibson and culminated in her honors thesis, which is currently in review for publication and available as a fully producible manuscript on GitHub.\nIn brief, she collected samples from 30 trees across the city, and then did high-throughput culturing and sequencing of isolated fungal endophytes to identify the taxa. Her community ecology analyses showed that the communities are structured by site and likely influenced by the string climatic gradient across the city caused by onshore winds from the cold Pacific.\nYears after Emma graduated, MS graduate student Ashley Sango and undergraduate student Victoria Lamar teamed up to look at the distribution of airborne microbes and spores across the city and how this distribution intersected with air quality."

However, we still know little about the mechanism of these biotic interactions and their consequences.\nThrough a series of projects over the past decade, we have been working to develop a better understanding of the consequences of endophyte infection. We’ve primarily been using Populus species as a model host for these experiments. Populus trichocarpa was the first tree to have its genome fully sequenced, and the (comparatively) fast growth and easy propagation of this genus from clonal cutting makes it useful to experiments.\nSome of the earliest studies we conducted were on Populus angustifolia (narrowleaf cottonwood), where we were looking at the effect of endophyte inoculation on pathogen damage (Busby et al. 2013).\nThrough a series of in vitro and in vivo inoculation experiments coupled with bright field and electron microscopy, we captured evidence that endophytes often enter the leaves through open stomatal pores (Huang, Zimmerman, and Arnold 2018).\nHere at USF, we have been working on a series of projects looking at foliar colonization of inoculated endophytes through staining and light microscopy (primarily led by undergraduate Natalie Ashburner-Wright) as well as a series of inoculation experiments in the greenhouse and in growth chambers to assess the functional consequences of these infections on host physiological performance. These experiments have been carried out both by Natalie and by MS student Jason Krastins alongside undergraduate Sayeh Jafari. Unfortunately a whole set of ongoing experiments in this focal area had to be shut down due to Spring 2020 COVID restrictions.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nBusby, Posy E, Naupaka B.

    "section": "",
    "text": "While there are numerous definitions of Open Science, many folks tend to emphasize the importance of open computational research practices and open access publishing. I like to remind myself that open science is and should be broader than that. Open science at its best is science that is not only transparent, reproducible, and freely available, but it is also science that is inclusive and open to other views. Below I’ve given some description of these various aspects of Open Science and places in my career where I’ve intersected with them.\nIn this lab, we aim to practice open science in its broadest sense to the best of our ability.\n\n\nFor most research in the STEM disciplines, there has been a big push to train scientists to use reproducible approaches to managing their data (Hart et al. 2016) and analyses (Hampton et al. 2015). Part of this is ensuring, as many journals now require, that the data and code used to generate the analyses in a published article are made available freely with the manuscript or in a public archival repository.\n\n\n\nEven if all code and data are freely available, being able to take the publicly available code and data and use them to re-run the analyses the authors conducted is often quite challenging. This is because the computational environment required to run the code may be quite specific to the individual scientist’s machine and not fully documented. To help mitigate this, analysis code can be made reusable and publicly available as a software package (e.g. an R package I helped write for analysis of terrestrial LiDAR data, Atkins et al. 2018).\nAnother important approach is having the pipeline or order of code execution well-documented or even better, automated. In all of my undergraduate courses at USF, I introduce students to the use of R and Rmarkdown to generate reproducible reports for their projects in class. For my graduate and undergraduate Bioinformatics courses, we go a step futher and learn the use of the program make for automating complex computational workflows in an efficient manner.\nHere’s an example of these approaches in practice. Emma Gibson was an honors undergraduate student in my lab at USF. She completed an honors thesis looking at communities of foliar endophytes in leaves of one of the most common street trees in San Francisco, Metrosideros excelsa. She conducted her analyses and wrote her thesis using R and Rmarkdown, and when we were ready to submit it for publication, we added the required computational environments to reproduce all analyses using Docker and renv. This project is available as a public repository on the Lab GitHub organization.\n\n\n\nPreprints are completed scientific manuscripts that are publicly posted and assigned a permanent Digital Object Identifier (DOI) through preprint archive servers like bioRxiv or EcoEvoRxiv. These have become much more popular in recent years, because they enable formal scientific exchanges and communication to happen much more rapidly than the months to years that it takes for a manuscript to work its way through peer review. Generally scientists will submit their complete manuscript both to a preprint server and to a journal for formal peer review at the same time, and then once the peer-reviewed article is accepted, the preprint is updated to reflect this fact. As preprints are freely available, posting them also helps advance the next goal, which is free and open access to research articles.\n\n\n\nOpen access publishing (at its core) is the idea that journal articles should not be locked behind paywalls. As much of the research in the United States (and elsewhere) is publicly funded, it doesn’t seem right to have the results of this work locked up and unavailable to most of the public (and even to many scientists who don’t have the means to afford access). This has become a key issue in the European Union and the US in the last several years, and soon I imagine this will become the status quo.\nOpen access publishing discussions also often involve a discussion of more open peer review. While it varies between disciplines, peer review in many journals is what is called ‘single blind’, which means that the reviewers know the identity of the author(s), but the author(s) doesn’t know the identities of the reviewers. This opacity can be both good and bad — it could protect more junior scientists from retaliation if they submit a negative review, but it also clearly results in a number of power imbalances that may not lead to optimal outcomes (such as reviewers writing overly critical reviews instead of offering constructive evaluation and feedback). When I was a graduate student, we worked with the editors of many of the journals published by the Ecological Society of America to think about ways that graduate students could become more involved in the review process and to build training programs that would help inculcate best practices at an early stage (Zimmerman, Salguero-Gomez, and Ramos 2011).\n\n\n\nDuring the time when I was a graduate student and postdoc, I became quite involved with the Ecological Society of America Student Section, eventually becoming chair of the section. One of the topics that repeatedly came up in discussions at that time was the lack of professional networks for students outside of countries with large professional societies in Ecology (e.g. the US and UK). With a team of other students and collaboration with the International Association for Ecology (INTECOL) we authored a number of articles articulating this problem and proposing some steps forward (Peter Sogaard Jørgensen et al. 2011; White et al. 2015; Peter Søgaard Jørgensen et al. 2015).\n\n\n\nIn the last several years, I have become involved with a collection of folks called the Microbes and Social Equity Working Group (Ishaq et al. 2021). Through this highly interdisciplinary group, I have helped to organize several sessions at ESA meetings over the years; these sessions were focused on widening the focus of microbial research to include the broader social context of the research as well as its implications for human communities."

Deep learning and true understanding of concepts come from individuals confronting inconsistencies in the way they currently think a set of ideas fit together. Thus, the role of a teacher is to help students identify these areas where understanding is incomplete and then help them develop the skills of critical thinking and a facility with the tools that will allow the students to create new mental structures for themselves. Ultimately, the best teachers can instill in students the cognitive and technical skills, and more importantly the motivation and self-confidence, to enable them to become life-long, self-directed learners."

Unfortunately, many undergraduates in the STEM disciplines don’t get an opportunity to experience this while they are students. Those lucky enough to participate in research experiences on campus or through summer programs like the National Science Foundation’s Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program get a taste, but these fortunate students are only a small subset of the total. We also know that there are substantial (financial, social, logistical) barriers to participation of minoritized students who would otherwise thrive in these settings (Chaudhary and Berhe 2020).

    "text": "Computational Training\nI use a practice-based integration of experiential, quantitative, and computational literacy as a core tenet of my own approach to teaching. As a postdoc, I co-authored a study that found that many students in Ecology felt that their exposure to quantitative (mathematical, statistical, computational) approaches to scientific practice was inadequate (Barraquand et al. 2014) and wished they had taken more such courses as undergraduates. Quantitative and computational literacy is particularly useful because it is a tool that makes it easier to figure out what it is that we don’t yet understand or know.\nMy conviction that computational skills are empowering for students and scientists at all levels have also grown out of numerous extramural teaching and training experiences over the past 15 years. The most formative of these for me have been my experiences with Software and Data Carpentry. These organizations (collectively, The Carpentries) are global, non-profit, volunteer organizations whose mission it is to help teach scientists best practices for research computing. The practical applications of the skills we teach (scripting in python or R, scripting and navigating using a shell, version control using git and GitHub, and structured data and databases) are immediately recognized, and many researchers have said they wished they had learned these skills much sooner in their studies or careers (Jordan et al. 2018).\nBeyond the Carpentries, I have also taught these computational skills in numerous workshops at national (Ecological Society of America) meetings, and as an invited instructor at several week-long Data Institutes at the National Ecological Observatory Network in Boulder, CO, where I helped teach ecologists at all career stages how to work with the large-scale remote sensing datasets produced by NEON. I have contributed to reproducible research curricula through in-person participation in workshops and hackathons at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS), the National Evolutionary Synthesis Center (NESCent), UC Berkeley’s Berkeley Institute for Data Science (BIDS), and online through peer code review for the rOpenSci project."

    "text": "Biogeography, ecological function, and evolution of plant microbiomes.\n Complete CV (updated March 2023)\n Naupaka Zimmerman is currently an Associate Professor in the Biology Department at the University of San Francisco, where he teaches courses in Microbiology, Ecology, Urban Ecology, California Ecology, and Bioinformatics (among others). He is broadly interested in the intersection between microbial community and ecosystem ecology, and is currently examining it in the context of endophytic fungal communities via next-gen molecular methods (e.g. Zimmerman et al. 2014). While these communities are incredibly diverse, particularly in the tropics, we know very little about their functions in ecosystems. Using a combination of field surveys and greenhouse manipulations, he is currently engaged in a number of different projects trying to understand what these enigmatic organisms are up to.\nPrior to USF, he was a postdoc at the University of Arizona as a Gordon and Betty Moore Fellow of the Life Sciences Research Foundation, working in the Arnold Lab. His work there focused on understanding the mechanisms of interaction between foliar endophytes and host (Huang, Zimmerman, and Arnold 2018) in black cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa), on the circumglobal biogeography of boreal endophytes (U’Ren et al. 2019), and the phylogenetic distinctness of endophytes in the Xylariaceae (U’Ren et al. 2016).\nHis PhD dissertation at Stanford (as part of the Vitousek Lab) focused primarily on the biogeography of communities of foliar fungal endophytes that inhabit the asymptomatic leaves of ʻōhiʻa (Metrosideros polymorpha), an endemic Hawaiian tree (Zimmerman and Vitousek 2012). He also worked on a number of collaborative projects examining the functional consequences of pathogen-endophyte-genotype interactions (Busby et al. 2013) in narrowleaf cottonwood (Populus angustifolia).\nAfter graduating from college, he spent a year in the Schrag geochemical oceanography lab as a technician reconstructing past climatic trends from oxygen isotope records in marine sulfate (e.g. Turchyn et al. 2009) and in cores from long-lived tropical tree species (e.g. Anchukaitis et al. 2008). He also spent a year teaching in Seoul, South Korea before starting grad school.\nHis undergrad degree was in Environmental Science and Public Policy and Social Anthropology at Harvard University. His interdisciplinary honors thesis focused on understanding how differing environmental conceptions (scientific, indigenous, economic, etc) play out in the construction of public narrative and policy. His ecological research during that time was focused on lowland wet forest communities along a substrate age (successional) gradient in Hawaiʻi, with particular focus on how invasive species alter the successional trajectories of these forests (Zimmerman et al. 2008).\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nAnchukaitis, K.
