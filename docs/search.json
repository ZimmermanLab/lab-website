We often start with field work locally in the Bay Area, at NEON Field Sites across the country, or at USF’s Star Route Farms. After culturing and isolating microbes, we use manipulative greenhouse and growth-chamber studies, culture- and molecular-based lab work, bright field and electron microscopy, and finally a good amount of computational and bioinformatic analyses to probe microbial community composition and function.\nInformation about joining the lab is available here. Note that while USF does not have any PhD programs, we do have a thesis-based MS in Biology program."

Deep learning and true understanding of concepts come from individuals confronting inconsistencies in the way they currently think a set of ideas fit together. Thus, the role of a teacher is to help students identify these areas where understanding is incomplete and then help them develop the skills of critical thinking and a facility with the tools that will allow the students to create new mental structures for themselves. Ultimately, the best teachers can instill in students the cognitive and technical skills, and more importantly the motivation and self-confidence, to enable them to become life-long, self-directed learners."

    "text": "Biogeography, ecological function, and evolution of plant microbiomes.\n Complete CV (updated March 2023)\n Naupaka Zimmerman is currently an Associate Professor in the Biology Department at the University of San Francisco, where he teaches courses in Microbiology, Ecology, Urban Ecology, California Ecology, and Bioinformatics (among others). He is broadly interested in the intersection between microbial community and ecosystem ecology, and is currently examining it in the context of endophytic fungal communities via next-gen molecular methods. While these communities are incredibly diverse, particularly in the tropics, we know very little about their functions in ecosystems. Using a combination of field surveys and greenhouse manipulations, he is currently engaged in a number of different projects trying to understand what these enigmatic organisms are up to.\nPrior to USF, he was a postdoc at the University of Arizona as a Gordon and Betty Moore Fellow of the Life Sciences Research Foundation, working in the Arnold Lab. His work there focused on understanding the mechanisms of interaction between foliar endophytes and host (Huang, Zimmerman, and Arnold 2018) in black cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa), and on the circumglobal biogeography of boreal endophytes (U’Ren et al. 2019).\nHis PhD dissertation at Stanford (as part of the Vitousek Lab) focused primarily on the biogeography of communities of foliar fungal endophytes that inhabit the asymptomatic leaves of ʻōhiʻa (Metrosideros polymorpha), an endemic Hawaiian tree (Zimmerman and Vitousek 2012). He also worked on a number of collaborative projects examining the functional consequences of pathogen-endophyte-genotype interactions (Busby et al. 2013) in narrowleaf cottonwood (Populus angustifolia).\nAfter graduating from college, he spent a year in the Schrag geochemical oceanography lab as a technician reconstructing past climatic trends from oxygen isotope records in marine sulfate (e.g. Turchyn et al. 2009) and in cores from long-lived tropical tree species (e.g. Anchukaitis et al. 2008). He also spent a year teaching in Seoul, South Korea before starting grad school.\nHis undergrad degree was in Environmental Science and Public Policy and Social Anthropology at Harvard University. His interdisciplinary honors thesis focused on understanding how differing environmental conceptions (scientific, indigenous, economic, etc) play out in the construction of public narrative and policy. His ecological research during that time was focused on lowland wet forest communities along a substrate age (successional) gradient in Hawaiʻi, with particular focus on how invasive species alter the successional trajectories of these forests (Zimmerman et al. 2008).\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nAnchukaitis, K.

    "text": "Computational Training\nI use a practice-based integration of experiential, quantitative, and computational literacy as a core tenet of my own approach to teaching. This is not only because such an approach was recommended in these two reports; I also co-authored a study that found that many students in Ecology felt that their exposure to quantitative (mathematical, statistical, computational) approaches to scientific practice was inadequate (Barraquand et al. 2014) and wished they had taken more such courses as undergraduates. Quantitative and computational literacy is particularly useful because it is a tool that makes it easier to figure out what it is that we don’t yet understand or know.\nMy conviction that computational skills are empowering for students and scientists at all levels have also grown out of numerous extramural teaching and training experiences over the past 10 years. The most formative of these for me have been my experiences with Software and Data Carpentry. These organizations (collectively, the Carpentries) are global, non-profit, volunteer organizations whose mission it is to help teach scientists best practices for research computing. The practical applications of the skills we teach (scripting in python or R, scripting and navigating the shell, version control using git and GitHub, and structured data and databases) are immediately recognized, and many researchers have said they wished they had learned these skills much sooner in their studies or careers (Jordan et al. 2018). Beyond the Carpentries, I have also taught these computational skills in numerous workshops at national (Ecological Society of America) meetings, and as an invited instructor at several week-long Data Institutes at the National Ecological Observatory Network in Boulder, CO, where I helped teach ecologists at all career stages how to work with the large-scale remote sensing datasets produced by NEON. I have contributed to reproducible research curricula through in-person participation in workshops and hackathons at UC Berkeley’s BIDS (Berkeley Institute for Data Science), and online through peer code review through the ROpenSci initiative."
