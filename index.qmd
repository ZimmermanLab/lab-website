::: {#hero-heading}

Welcome to the website for the Zimmerman Lab at the [University of San Francisco](https://www.usfca.edu/). Our research focuses on understanding the ecology and evolution of plant-associated microbes, with a special affection for foliar endophytic fungi.

The lab is led by [Dr. Naupaka Zimmerman](https://www.usfca.edu/faculty/naupaka-zimmerman) and is made up of [many other wonderful folks](people/index.qmd), including undergraduate researchers, Master's students, and sometimes even high school students or other visiting researchers.

We use a range of approaches in our work, ranging from field work and greenhouse studies, to molecular lab work, and through to bioinformatic analyses.
