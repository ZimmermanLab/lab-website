::: {#hero-heading}

Welcome to the website for the Zimmerman Lab at the [University of Kansas](https://www.ku.edu). Our research focuses on understanding the ecology and evolution of plant-associated microbes, with a special affection for foliar endophytic fungi.

The lab is led by [Dr. Naupaka Zimmerman](people/naupaka_zimmerman/index.qmd), an Assistant Professor in the Environmental Studies Program at KU. Over the years the lab group has been made up of [many other wonderful folks](people/index.qmd), including undergraduate researchers, Master's students, and sometimes even high school students or other visiting researchers.

We use a range of approaches in our [research](projects/index.qmd) on plant-associated microbial communities. We often start with field work locally in Kansas or at [NEON Field Sites](https://www.neonscience.org/field-sites) across the country. After culturing and isolating microbes, we use manipulative greenhouse and growth-chamber studies, culture- and molecular-based lab work, bright field and electron microscopy, and finally a good amount of computational and bioinformatic analyses to probe microbial community composition and function.

Information about joining the lab is [available here](join.qmd). Note that while KU Environmental Studies does not have any PhD programs, graduate admission may be possible through the [Ecology and Evolutionary Biology program](https://eeb.ku.edu/how-apply).
